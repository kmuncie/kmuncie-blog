### I live in Brooklyn Heights, New York now.

The journey here was a road trip. Big moments in my life usually involve and envelope them.

This 3,000+ mile roadtrip took me to see family and friends and make a few new ones. I had my very good friend, Sean Yarbenet, along for the ride. We had an excellent trip together, we are both experienced travelers and took everyday as an adventure.

This way my first experience of the true Eastern Seaboard. While it has no way of competing with the raw beauty of the West Coast and California it does have its charm in places. My favorite stop on the trip was easily Savannah, Georgia. It was a beautiful and historic city that makes you feel relaxed no matter where you were. A huge contributing factor to this was the city layout referred to as “[The Oglethorpe Plan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oglethorpe_Plan)“. I have never experience a bustling city with such beauty, calmness and discoverability around every corner. It truly encouraged you to walk and experience the city at street level.
