I am really loving this game! I used to spend hours playing SimCity 2000 on my desktop. While I wish this were a direct port of that game, I am being entertained none the less.

I wish it had a deeper game play. The beauty of SimCity 2000 was the graphs and overlays so that you could fight specific problems and better understand how to lay out your city in an efficient manner. It frustrates me to have this game constantly telling me I have a great road system only to immediatly be told people are moving away because they cant get to work. Why!? No deeper explanation is available. 

My other big gripe is not being able to rotate the view. This doesnt strike me as being a large problem and yet it would really help in construction and satisfy my desire to see the beautiful city I just spent hours creating. 

Overall, it is one of the best games for the iPhone. I just hope EA takes advantage of updates to fix bugs and add new features.  I give it an 8.5/10
