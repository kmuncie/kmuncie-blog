Everyone loves a good cat video. I recently toyed with this love by posting a very simple video of my cat Waffle to my YouTube channel. I uploaded it on December 19th, 2011. My expectations were low since I have no reputation for these types of videos. I took the video with my phone and uploaded it directly, no graphics or music added, very dry by my standards.

It exploded on Christmas day. It seems everyone is so bored while on holiday that they turn to YouTube for entertainment. Other than the span of a few days around Christmas the video has received very few other views.

Another interesting thing I found in the analytics was where this traffic was coming from. I expected to get some traffic from other cat videos because I loaded up on tags and keywords, but I got more traffic from mobile devices overall. I guess everyone was sitting at home, surrounded by family, playing with their phones. Lovely.
