On Monday I decided to go hiking in the Lincoln National Forest just north of Ruidoso, NM. The area has gotten a few snows but most of it has melted off and it was not extremely cold, I just wore a couple layers and did fine. Hiking at altitude is always an interesting experience. Breathing is much more difficult and your heart races to keep the limited oxygen flowing.

I started the hike at 3:00 pm at the Bonito Trailhead which was a good drive from Ruidoso. I stopped at the Forest Service ranger station to get maps and suggestions. Bonito trail was interesting with some nice trees and multiple creek crossings.

But it wasnâ€™t my favorite forest to hike, not the prettiest and very little wildlife. However it would probably be much better at a different time of year, everything is ready for snow. I should have started a lot earlier because I had to hurray back shortly after reaching Crest Trail because of dark creeping up. Would have loved to explore a lot more on Crest Trail which was scenic. It was almost to dark to see by the time I got back to the car. I need to do this more often and build my leg strength up, I am very sore now after the hike.
