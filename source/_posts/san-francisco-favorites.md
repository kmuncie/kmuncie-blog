San Francisco is a unique and amazing city. It's geographical location gives it a feel unlike any other city in the United States. My wife grew up in San Francisco and so we go there for a visit usually once a year.

When you visit I hope the following suggestion help, they are our favorite places in the Bay Area!

## Food

San Francisco is a diverse city with many health conscious people. It also has a huge number of wealthy people, so the foodie scene is extremely strong and good food can be found in all corners. We tend to look for affordable, authentic food made by people who care. This list is a reflection of that.

### Kabul Afghan Cuisine (Peninsula)

A bit outside the city but seriously great food, especially if you want lots of amazing grilled meats!

### Little Sheep Hot Pot

Little Sheep is a chain, but this location is great and this meal is great for a group that wants to spend a few hours eating!

Hole-in-the-wall Korean restaurant that gets filled up very quickly. Great food and cool atmosphere.

### Fisherman's Wharf Clam Chowder

Gotta get a bread bowl full of clam chowder when you visit Fisherman's Wharf. Just beware of the birds, they are quite aggressive due to all the tourist that feed them regularly.

### Zachary's Chicago Pizza (East Bay)

This insane pizza may require a wait but it is very much worth it. Likely better than most of the pizza you can get in Chicago itself. A must stop if you are in the East Bay.

### FRED'S Place (Sausalito)

Cool old school dinner for a delicious breakfast if you had up north over the Golden Gate bridge.

A historic tiki bar in the Fairmont Hotel. It's touristy and all about sweet but strong tropical drinks, but its an absolute blast with a group of friends.
