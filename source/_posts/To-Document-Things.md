I got a new camera! I have not had a way to record videos for nearly a year. I used to love creating short videos for YouTube. Now I finally have something that shoots HD and has a great zoom. It’s a Panasonic DMC-ZS3 – I bought it on Amazon.com. Here is a short video I made mainly to test its capabilities and figure out what editing software I was going to use. Looks like Windows Live Movie Maker is going to work the best for me, for now.
