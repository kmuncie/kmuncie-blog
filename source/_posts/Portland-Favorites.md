*Updated January 2020*

I very nearly moved to Portland, Oregon back in 2009 but it never ended up being a home for me. Instead, it is a place I absolutely love to visit. Below are some of our favorite places in Portland. I hope it comes in handy!

## Food

Portland is a foodie town. You will be overwhelmed by the sheer number of highly reviewed resturants in almost all corners of the city. Here are a few of our personal favorites.

### Sesame Donuts

Forget about Vodoo Donuts, go to Sesame Donuts. They have multiple locations though we prefer this 24/7 location. Ask for a sample of the sesame donut holes, they are surprisingly good. One of my favorite donut shops in the country.

### Little Big Burger

This burger joint is a popular chain in Portland. It's similar to your standard Shake Shack, Five Guys, or Smashburger. Prices are good and everything is delicious. (Ace says - plus, truffle fries!)

### Pine State Biscuits

Pure guilty comfort food. You will always leave here feeling full no matter how much you order. Amazing biscuit-based sandwiches that are basically a must-have when visiting Portland. Don't forget to grab a Bloody Mary or a beer while here!

### Waffle Window

A must-have for a breakfast or brunch, the waffles explode with sugar and deliciousness. We recommend visiting the location on NE Alberta Street since it's bigger and offers indoor seating.

## Coffee

Portland, like Seattle, is serious about coffee. Below are our favorite places to get caffeinated.

## Drinks

{% asset_img IMG_9186.JPG "Upright Brewing in Portland Oregon is the best" %}

Portland has an unbelievable beer scene, but it's easy to get distracted by the upstarts and hipster joints. Below are our favorite legit places to get an outstanding beer.

### Upright Brewing

Literally the best beer in Portland but also the hardest to find and get to. In a basement. Hard to find, with very little parking. But it's worth the effort to stop by and have a beer.

{% iframe https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d11178.904167711114!2d-122.67237477606373!3d45.535718274580034!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0xb7906c040673335c!2sUpright+Brewing!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1494987988035 100% 300px %}

### Cascade Brewing Barrel House

Great barrel-aged beer, lots of sours and fruit-based experiments. Wide distribution but worth a stop if you're in the area.

### Rogue Eastside Pub

This used to be the Green Dragon and our favorite brewery/taproom. It recently was renovated by Rogue so we are not sure how it is now but it used to always have amazing beer on tap.

The quintenssential Oregon beach. If you go to the coast this is the first stop. Make sure you stop on the drive to get some pure mountain water on the side of the road and also try to visit Ecola State Park just north of this beach.
